            Any mail that you now receive that has been classified by MailScanner and SpamAssassin as Spam will be
            automatically moved to the folder that you created. You should check this daily to make sure that no
            legitimate mail has been mis-classified (this is called a false-positive) and delete any other mails.<BR>
            <BR>
            Any false-positives (mail wrongly classified as Spam) or false-negatives (mail not classified as Spam that
            should have been) should be moved or copied into the 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' public folders (Public
            Folders/SpamAssassin) so that the software can be 'trained' on these messages to reduce the possibility of
            mis-classifying similar messages in the future.<BR/><BR/><A HREF="docs.php?doc=howto_train_spamassassin">Click
