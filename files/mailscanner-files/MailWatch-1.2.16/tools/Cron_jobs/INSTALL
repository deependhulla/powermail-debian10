INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------

Copy the file 'mailwatch' into /etc/cron.daily/:

# cp tools/Cron_jobs/mailwatch /etc/cron.daily/.

Copy and rename the file 'mailwatch.cron.monthly' into /etc/cron.monthly/mailwatch

# cp tools/Cron_jobs/mailwatch.cron.monthly /etc/cron.monthly/mailwatch

Copy in /usr/local/bin the following files:

mailwatch_db_clean.php
mailwatch_quarantine_maint.php

mailwatch_geoip_update.php

Verify if the 4 files are executable. If not, use "chmod +x" to correct this problem.

-------------------------------------------
Database cleanup of maillog records
-------------------------------------------

You need to edit conf.php and change the RECORD_DAYS_TO_KEEP definition.

--------------------------------------------
Quarantine Maintenance
--------------------------------------------

You need to edit in conf.php the QUARANTINE_DAYS_TO_KEEP variable.

For MailScanner v4: Delete the clean.quarantine cron file.

For MailScanner v5: Change the variable for Quarantine Retention to "q_days=0" in /etc/MailScanner/defaults.

--------------------------------------------
MailScanner Rule Editor (optional)
--------------------------------------------

Configure the file msre_reload to fit your need.

Copy the file msre_reload into /etc/cron.d/.

See the instructions in tools/MailScanner_rule_editor/INSTALL

--------------------------------------------
GeoIP Update
--------------------------------------------

MaxMind now requires a free license key to obtain GeoLite2 data.

Visit www.maxmind.com to create an account and generate a license key.  
MaxMind will ask questions to generate a key, any choice will work.
Once you have generated a key, place the key in conf.php for MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY.

Default update is one time per month in /etc/cron.monthly/.

The sudoers file /etc/sudoers.d/mailwatch must be installed.

Maxmind is very strict about the update conditions. Be cautious not to poll Maxmind GeoIP too often with cron.

ATTENTION:

Several files have changed their name and location in MailWatch 1.2.0, 
particularly the PHP files that are launched in cron and the Init script files.
Please read the documentation carefully to remove old files during the upgrade.
