INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------

The mailwatch_sendmail_queue.php script process the MTA Exim or Sendmail queue to store messages 
in MailWatch database and see them in the MailWatch GUI.

For best result, you need to install the imap PHP package (php5-imap)
but mailwatch_sendmail_queue.php can work without it.

Copy the mailwatch_sendmail_queue.php file in /usr/local/bin

Verify if the file is executable. If not, use "chmod +x" to correct this problem.

Edit CRONTAB:

# crontab -e

# Run each minute
0-59 * * * * 	/usr/local/bin/mailwatch_sendmail_queue.php

Note: mailwatch_sendmail_queue.php re-creates all entries on each run, 
so for busy sites you will probably want to change this to run every 5 minutes or greater.

ATTENTION:

Several files have changed their name and location in MailWatch 1.2.0, 
particularly the PHP files that are launched in cron and the Init script files.
Please read the documentation carefully to remove old files during the upgrade.

Since MailWatch 1.2.0, you no longer need to use mailwatch_sendmail_queue.php
with Exim MTA. Call to Exim queue is now managed by direct call using 'exim -bpc'.
