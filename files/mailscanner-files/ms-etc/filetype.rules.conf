# NOTE: Fields are separated by TAB characters --- Important!
#
# Syntax is allow/deny/deny+delete/rename/email-addresses,
#           then regular expression,
#           then log text,
#           then user report text.
#
# The "email-addresses" can be a space or comma-separated list of email
# addresses. If the rule hits, the message will be sent to these address(es)
# instead of the original recipients.

# If a rule is a "rename" rule, then the attachment filename will be renamed
# according to the "Default Rename Pattern" setting in MailScanner.conf.

#
# If none of the rules match, then the filetype is allowed.
#
# An optional fifth field can also be added before the "log text", which
# makes the checked text check against the MIME type of the attachment
# as determined by the output of the "file -i" command.
