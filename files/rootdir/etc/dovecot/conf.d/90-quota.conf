##
## Quota limits
##

# Quota limits are set using "quota_rule" parameters. To get per-user quota
# limits, you can set/override them by returning "quota_rule" extra field
# from userdb. It's also possible to give mailbox-specific limits, for example
# to give additional 100 MB when saving to Trash:

plugin {
quota = maildir:User quota
#  quota_rule = *:storage=1GB
  # 10% of 1GB = 100MB
#  quota_rule2 = Trash:storage=+10%%
  # 20% of 1GB = 200MB
#  quota_rule3 = Spam:storage=+20%%

#  quota_rule = *:storage=2G
#  quota_rule2 = Trash:storage=+100M
 quota_grace = 1%%
    # 10% is the default
    quota_status_success = DUNNO
    quota_status_nouser = DUNNO
    quota_status_overquota = "552 5.2.2 Mailbox is full"
#   quota_exceeded_message =452 Quota exceeded, Please contact user on phone to free some space.
  # LDA/LMTP allows saving the last mail to bring user from under quota to
  # over quota, if the quota doesn't grow too high. Default is to allow as
  # long as quota will stay under 10% above the limit. Also allowed e.g. 10M.
}

##
## Quota warnings
##

# You can execute a given command when user exceeds a specified quota limit.
# Each quota root has separate limits. Only the command for the first
# exceeded limit is excecuted, so put the highest limit first.
# The commands are executed via script service by connecting to the named
# UNIX socket (quota-warning below).
# Note that % needs to be escaped as %%, otherwise "% " expands to empty.

plugin {
#  quota_warning = storage=95%% quota-warning 95 %u
#  quota_warning2 = storage=80%% quota-warning 80 %u
}

# Example quota-warning service. The unix listener's permissions should be
# set in a way that mail processes can connect to it. Below example assumes
# that mail processes run as vmail user. If you use mode=0666, all system users
# can generate quota warnings to anyone.
#service quota-warning {
#  executable = script /usr/local/bin/quota-warning.sh
#  user = dovecot
#  unix_listener quota-warning {
#    user = vmail
#  }
#}

##
## Quota backends
##

service quota-status {
    executable = quota-status -p postfix
    inet_listener {
	address = 127.0.0.1
        port = 12340
        # You can choose any port you want
    }
    client_limit = 1
}


# Multiple backends are supported:
#   dirsize: Find and sum all the files found from mail directory.
#            Extremely SLOW with Maildir. It'll eat your CPU and disk I/O.
#   dict: Keep quota stored in dictionary (eg. SQL)
#   maildir: Maildir++ quota
#   fs: Read-only support for filesystem quota

plugin {
  #quota = dirsize:User quota
  quota = maildir:User quota
  quota = dict:User quota::proxy::quota
  #quota = fs:User quota
}

# Multiple quota roots are also possible, for example this gives each user
# their own 100MB quota and one shared 1GB quota within the domain:
plugin {
  #quota = dict:user::proxy::quota
  #quota2 = dict:domain:%d:proxy::quota_domain
  #quota_rule = *:storage=102400
  #quota2_rule = *:storage=1048576
}
